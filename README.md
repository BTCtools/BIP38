# BIP38

A Java implementation of the BIP-0038 Draft: [Passphrase-protected private key](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0038.mediawiki) for Bitcoin.

## Usage

`BIP38.encryptEC(password, lot, sequence)` generates an encrypted key starting with 6P. 
If you don't care about lot/sequence (if you don't know what they are, you don't care),
   just use -1 for the lot. That will cause those parameters to be ignored.

`BIP38.encryptNoEC(password, encodedKey, isCompressed)` encrypts a known key.

`BIP38.decrypt(password, encryptedKey)` yields the decrypted get.

## Example

   Key generation:

   `encrypt("hello", -1, -1)`

   might produce 

   `6PgMiWeAFVWrLUohAiM5YdtGjaZwaHGoLH6oaUysnkt6XuQS7VXcRmmuWs`

   Decryption:

   `decrypt(hello, "6PgMiWeAFVWrLUohAiM5YdtGjaZwaHGoLH6oaUysnkt6XuQS7VXcRmmuWs")`

   will result in

   `5JtA62jW9F38PU4T116PE6rfmz3b2X2auLWWHKfCyzzWdqEP8qB`

   which corresponds to address

   `1hE5eAbTrqEJZHLP8J1Eje5HHJU9aHVrj`

## To do

  * implement the remaining functionality from the spec.
  * write more tests.

## Note for OSX

If you get an exception about an illegal key size, you probably need to install
the [Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce-7-download-432124.html)
